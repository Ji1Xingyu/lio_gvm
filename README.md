# LIO_GVM

## Exciting News! 
We are thrilled to announce that our paper has been accepted by RA-L!

## Project Update
Currently, my focus is directed towards an ongoing project, which has limited my ability to dedicate time to the `LIO_GVM` code. However, I am committed to organizing and refining the code for this project. Please stay tuned, as I plan to release the updated and improved code by the end of March (jus after the DDL of 2024 IROS :)).

## Research Paper
For those interested in the detailed workings and methodologies of our project, please refer to our paper titled [LIO-GVM: an Accurate, Tightly-Coupled Lidar-Inertial Odometry with Gaussian Voxel Map](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17436.pdf)

## Acknowledgements and Collaborations
